Over the past few years, I have stumbled upon a number of beutiful blogs created using static site generators such as Jekyll and Pelican. 
Because these frameworks allow for infinite customization and are targeted towards developers, many of these blogs have cool, unique designs. For a particularily
neat example of what kind of blog you can make with one of these frameworks, I invite you to check out this [rad pokemon themed blog](https://eev.ee/blog/) written by the patreon funded, indie OSS hacker/game developer Eevee.

Blogs like this make me nostalgic for the days of the Olde Internet -  A time when the internet was new and exciting,
and represented a spirit of boundless optimism for the future of humanity.  A time when the internet belonged primarily to hobbyists, technical people, and those who otherwise have interest in being on the cutting edge of what the human race is doing. An internet before everything was a Facebook page, or a Twitter post, or even a Tumblr blog or a Livejournal - tools such as these were still in their infancy - creating something required you to get your hands dirty, and share a bit of your soul and individuality with the world. The internet was a colorful place in stark contrast to the polished, sanded down corporate internet of today.

I have decided to try my hand at creating my own little piece of the internet that captures this spirit by using one of these customizable, developer centric blogging technologies. The result of that decision is this blog. Over time, I expect to customize the look and feel of this blog to reflect my soul.

I was initially interested in creating this blog with the [Jekyll framework](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/), but have decided to use [Pelican framework](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/) instead. I preffer Pelican because it is written in Python rather than Jekyll's Ruby, the setup tool seems a bit nicer, and the docs seem better for it in general and have clear instructions for how to deploy to Github pages baked right into them. It also seems easier to integrate with pre-built custom themes. I do plan on creating my own theme one day, but getting content out the door as soon as possible will help this blog succeed. Using someone else's theme to start with helps me do that.

Something elise I like about making a blog using Pelican, aside from the high degree of customizability it offers me, is that I can retain full ownership of the blog's content as well as full control over how it is hosted. If I used some third party blogging soluton or a social network like Facebook to host my content, I'd have to worry about the service provider possibly [going the way of the Tumblr Fiasco on me](https://www.forbes.com/sites/masonsands/2018/12/20/tumblocalypse-where-tumblr-and-its-users-are-headed-after-the-ban/#61c6aa4c7020). Generating my own site with Pelican and then hosting it where I choose helps ensure that my speech remains free and owned by me.

I am excited to get this blog underway. If youve stumbled here and made it this far, thank you for reading :)
