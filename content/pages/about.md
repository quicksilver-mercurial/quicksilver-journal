Title: About Mercurial

Hello. I am Mercurial, the author of this blog. I am not to be confused with the [version control system of the same name](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/). I chose the name Mercurial because it reflects my ever changing sense of self.

I think in general what the universe wants most from me is for me to love and appreciate it as much as possible. I believe this because the more things I love about the world, the more I enjoy being alive. Some things I enjoy in particular are science fiction, software development, politics, history, music, and tabletop roleplaying games. Most of all I enjoy having nice moments with my friends and family.

Thank you for reading. Feel free to contact me for any reason at quicksilver.mercurial@gmail.com
