Steph treats people very well, being a thoughtful, considerate, people-liking person. They have many passions, such as weightlifting, Jiu-Jitsu, reading, and hiking, and they share these passions and their passion for life in general freely with those around them. Steph is someone you can have an excellent time talking to for hours on end without ever getting bored or feeling uncomfortable. Steph is a great listener (to the point where I sometimes feel like im talking too much when talking to them) and has an endless amount of interesting things to add to conversations. Listening to Steph talk about their many adventures is sure to entertain and to expand one's worldview. 

Steph also has excellent taste in ice cream.
